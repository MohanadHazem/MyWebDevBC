My web development bootcamp (by Colt Steele) solutions
This repo is the final project in the Web Development Bootcamp online course on Udemy.
Each folder contains a different version or stage that Colt Steele (the instructor) walks us through in the course.
It will look very similar to the one he posted as it is done step by step as per his instructions.
